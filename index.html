    <!-- Single page applications where different views, most of the UI are all handled on the same page. Page contains all the views for the app, loading from the Node API. React sends AJAX call to the Node API, gets or posts information to a database, database sends back an object to the Node API, then returns a JSON object to React.   -->

    <!-- Much minimized page refreshes with a SPA as multiple views are loaded on to one page. examples: FB, twitter, gmail.  -->

    <!-- React purpose: fast, scalable and simple. -->
    <!-- 1. Declarative: easier to add interactive UI's. Design simple views for each state of the application. React efficiently updates and renders correct components when data changes. Makes code more predictable and easier to debug. -->

    <!-- 2. component-based: manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UI's. JS logic instead of templates, pass data through app and keep out of the DOM. -->

    <!-- 3. JSX - use HTML quoting, and HTML tags to render subcomponents.  -->

    <!-- single way data flow: properties flow down, actions flow up. -->

<!-- TRaversy below -->

<!-- primarily focused on user interfaces. no assumptions about rest of app, like db's/models. strictly for UI. Model View Controller, react is the view of MVC. react can be used on client or server.  -->


<!-- React has a virtual DOM, a slimmer version of the DOM in the browser. only updates the parts  that need to be re rendered. It's faster -->

<!-- React is simple, handles all UI updates for you, refreshes only updated parts of the app. everything a component, easier to read, and re-use code.  -->

<!-- uses JSX: JS syntax extension, HTML inside react components. not required, but highly recommended, makes things easier. -->

<!-- Babel JS compiler: to use JSX, tools needed to transform it into javascript. Babel JS compiler, and webpack.  -->
<!-- add <script type="text/babel" to script tags or it won't work. -->

  <!-- React component example - 
  var HelloMessage = React.createClass({
    render:function() {
      return <div>Hello{this.props.name}</div>;
    }
  });
    ReactDOM.render(
      <HelloMessage name="John" />,
      Document.getElementById('app'));
    )
-->
<!-- component called HelloMessage setting equal to React.createClass.
lifecycle functions - render is one.
it'll return the component markup which is <div> Hello{this.props.name}, 
  bottom is where component is rendered.
name property is accessed above in the component.
2nd paramter is at bottom - Document.getElementById('app') is id of the element where we want to insert the Hello component. -->

<!-- States and Props

components can 

- hold properties (props) that can be passed in as attributes.
- maintain internal "state" data. 
: for objects, strings, numbers etc.
- when state changed, component is re-rendered and markup is updated. Making React very dynamic.
this.set.state
-->

<!-- Lifecycle methods

fired off when component is rendered or updated.
common ones:

render- only one required, renders the application.

getInitialState - default values for states.
getDefaultProps
componentWillMount
componentDidMount-->
